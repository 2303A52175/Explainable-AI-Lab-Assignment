Summary

We trained a RandomForestRegressor on the UCI Energy Efficiency dataset to predict heating/cooling loads.
Feature influence was analyzed using Permutation Importance (PI), SHAP (global + local), and LIME (local).
PI identified which features most affect model performance, SHAP explained both overall and individual predictions with direction, and LIME provided interpretable local surrogate models.
Comparisons highlight consistent drivers across methods and context-specific differences.

Bullet Insights

1. Building shape and Height are the most important factors.
2. Surface Area and Roof Area also strongly affect heating/cooling demand.
3. Glazing has a smaller effect but usually increases loads when larger.
4. PI and SHAP mostly agree on top features, but SHAP shows whether they push loads up or down.
5. LIME and SHAP local results match: small, compact buildings use less energy; large areas raise demand.
6. PI is global (overall feature importance), while SHAP and LIME explain each building individually.
7. All methods confirm that geometry matters most, while glazing plays a smaller role.
